COMP379 - Machine Learning


This project assesses different machine learning binary classification algorithms that can be used to predict the benign or malignant characteristic of a tumor. The train and test sets were consistent between all four types of algorithms. The specific CSV files are included. Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, and Adaline Perceptron were the four chosen algorithms to test on this data. The goal is not only to find the best model (optimizing the hyperparameters within each model), but also to discover which algorithm returns the highest accruacy for this particualar dataset.
